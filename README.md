# Deep Learning Models and Techniques

This repository contains various deep learning models and techniques implemented in Jupyter Notebooks using Google Colab. It covers a range of topics from foundational concepts to advanced architectures, including:

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for MNIST digit classification.
- **Dense Neural Networks** and analysis of overfitting.
- **Gradient Descent Techniques** and vanishing gradient problems.
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**.
- **ResNet and VGG16** deep learning architectures.
- **Random Search** for hyperparameter optimization.

Each notebook demonstrates practical examples and experiments for learning and experimenting with deep learning.
